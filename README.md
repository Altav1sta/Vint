Vint is very interesting and hard to learn commercial card game. More info about how to play, game rules and history of Vint 
you can find in <b>"Manual.pdf"</b>.

I created this game to help my friend with his diploma. This version is not final. I gonna hardly improve interface and try to fix mistakes.
