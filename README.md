Vint is very interesting and hard to learn commercial card game. More info about how to play, game rules and history of Vint 
you can find in <a href="https://github.com/Altav1sta/Vint/blob/master/Manual.pdf">Manual</a>.

I created this game to help my friend with his diploma. This version is not final. I gonna hardly improve interface and try to fix mistakes.

Any <a href="https://github.com/Altav1sta/Vint/issues/1">commentaries</a> are welcome!
